									In my current position, I've discovered a fulfilling work environment surrounded by supportive colleagues. 
									Despite being in Boston, the camaraderie and positive atmosphere have made it a job I genuinely enjoy. 
									Familial responsibilities and practical considerations have led me to explore opportunities back in NYC. 
									I'm eager to continue engaging in work that I love while being closer to my roots and contributing to the community I call home.
								</p>
								<p>
									Navigating the dynamic landscape of design and manufacturing engineering, along with my role in hybrid supply chain vendor management, has been both a challenging and enriching experience. 
									However, the current job scenario and geographical constraints have posed unique challenges. 
									As someone who thrives on continuous learning and exploration, I've often found myself diving headfirst into new hobbies, dedicating all my time to mastering the latest passion.
								</p>
								<p>
									In the professional realm, my current job scenario presents a conundrum. 
									Despite my dedication to the hybrid supply chain vendor management role over the past year, the lack of seniority hinders seamless transitions within the organization. 
									Simultaneously, returning to my previous engineering role feels like a distant prospect.
									In response to this professional crossroads, I've embarked on a new chapter—studying for my fundamentals of engineering exam. 
									This deliberate step not only reflects my commitment to continuous improvement but also opens doors to a broader spectrum of opportunities in the engineering realm. 
									It's a journey marked by resilience, adaptability, and a proactive stance in the face of career challenges. As I navigate this intricate path, the goal remains clear: to leverage my engineering background and passion for innovation to carve out a fulfilling and impactful career.
